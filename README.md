# ShakshukaAI
Subject: I was too lazy to copy-paste from ChatGPT, so I built "Shakshuka AI" 🍳
The Problem: We all do it. We ask ChatGPT for code, we select it, we go to our IDE, we delete the old code, we paste the new code, we save, and then we run. It takes like... 10 seconds. In 2026, that’s basically an eternity.

The Solution: Shakshuka AI v01 I built a lightweight IDE for people who want to "cook" code fast without the overhead of heavy tools. It’s designed for the ChatGPT workflow.

Why it’s better than your current IDE:

The Atomic Paste: One orange button that clears your file, pastes the AI code, and saves it instantly. 1.2 seconds and you're done.

The Panic Button: A "Fix with AI" feature that bundles your errors and sends them back to the AI for a fix when you have no idea what’s going on.

Zero Learning Curve: No menus, no complex settings. Just Paste, Run, and Build EXE.

The Vibe: It’s named after a breakfast dish because coding should be as satisfying as a good meal.

Status: It’s free, it’s fast, and it’s version 01
